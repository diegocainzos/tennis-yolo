# Tennis YOLO

Tennis YOLO is a computer vision project that uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect and track tennis balls and players in real-time. This project aims to provide accurate and efficient detection for various applications such as sports analytics, automated refereeing, and player performance analysis.

## Features

- Real-time detection of tennis balls and players
- High accuracy and efficiency using the YOLO algorithm
- Easy integration with video feeds and camera systems
- Customizable for different tennis court environments

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tennis-yolo.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd tennis-yolo
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your video feed or camera input.
2. Run the detection script:
    ```
    python detect.py --source your_video.mp4
    ```
3. View the results in real-time or save them for further analysis.
